# HiggsBosonMachineLearning

Tools: R
Project Description: This is part of an experimenting conducted by CERN Laboratories. When two particles are excited at high speed and collided with each other, they emit so many other properties like weight, velocity, angle. All the properties are captured and collision is classified as either "Signal" or "Background". Scientists want to predict the type of collision given the properties.

For this predictive modelling, we used RandomForest, kNN, SVM and Aritificial Neural Networks.
Trained the model using caret package to find optimal parameters.
